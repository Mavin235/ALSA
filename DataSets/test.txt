After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a $T$ , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .

A brief conversation with the $T$ at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been " blown off " would be an understatement .
manager
The $T$ continually interrupted with " Is there anything else I can do for you ? " , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .

- Mediocre $T$ / Quality
Service
The presentation of $T$ is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .

To start off , approximately 8-10 oz of $T$ will cost you $ 3 .

They serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small $T$ at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .

I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their $T$ was so unique that I continued .

The $T$ were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 " pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 " ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced .

The $T$ should be larger ( at least 8 " ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .

On my meal I had to send back my $T$ for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if I hadn 't rejected the meal all together .

meal
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the $T$ and I was too frustrated to continue .
dish
To their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no $T$ stopped by to ask what the problem was .

– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at $T$ last Friday completely exceeded my expectations .
Ray 's Boathouse
Ray 's is something of a Seattle institution , but given its gorgeous $T$ , I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .
Sound views
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the $T$ are only the third-best thing about Ray 's !

My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous $T$ , smoked albacore tuna , Ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .

The $T$ are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .

Our $T$ continued to be attentive throughout the night , but I did remain puzzled by one issue : Who thinks that Ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?

All considered , I have to say that $T$ is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution .

While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful $T$ and food made the experience a very positive one .
