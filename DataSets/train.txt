The $T$ has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .

Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden $T$ , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .
